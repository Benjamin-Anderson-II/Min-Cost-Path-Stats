# Min-Cost-Path-Stats
Generates random numbers files full of random numbers, generates an AVL tree from said numbers and finds the 99% confidence interval of the population average of time taken to find the min-cost path

## To Run This Code:
- run the python script with the command line args in the following order:
  - lower bound for random number generation
  - upper bound from random number generation
  - ammount of random numbers you want to generate in each file
  - what directory you want the files to go into
  - the number of files you wish to create (must be >= 50)
- run the Makefile with `make`
- run the executable file produced by the C code
- go into RStudio and run the Rscript
